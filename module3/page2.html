		<p>Audio: "A majority of the questions you will see will revolve around figurative language, tone, theme, and author's message.

Theme=  its underlying message. Do not confuse theme with love or a story about family. Those are not theme's. Themes are lessons to be learned: crime doesn't pay, overcoming the odds, or  love conquers all. 
Author's message= is the purpose, or their motivation. Their whole reason why they decided to write their story"</p>
