		<p>Please read the text below.</p>
		<p>You scampered down this well-worn path when you were just a pup. And as we grew, I ran with you. I struggled to keep up.</p>
		<p>My legs grew long. Your legs grew slow. You're happy now to walk, ignoring all those squirrels and birds you once would chase and stalk. </p>
		<p>And as we walk I think of all the moments that we shared. The day we found you at the pound, you looked so small and scared. The times I fed you table scraps in spite of Mother's rule. </p>
		<p>The days you greeted me with joy when I came home from school. And as we walk this well-worn path, no longer running free, I hope I was as good to you as you have been to me.</p>
