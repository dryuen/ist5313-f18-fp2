  <div class="text">"You will come across a question that will ask you to pick the very best summary.  You will need to answer this question last and you will need to have read the passage.  
The STAAR test will give you a bad summary, an okay summary and two summaries that sound really good but only one is will be the "best" summary.  If you look at the question, you will realize that all of the answers are summaries but not all of them are the "best".
Here is how you can pick out the bad summaries:They are short or do not give very much detail. They only focus on a part of the passage.
Cross out one of the option choices that you can tell is a bad choice. If one of the summaries is incorrect or out of order, cross that one out too
If you get stuck between 2 answers, figure out what is different between them. Use you tie breaker techniques developed in the previous module.</div>
