					<p>If you did not pass the STAAR don't get mad. This test is not a measure of intelligence. 
						In order to pass the test, you need to play their game. For example, let say the STAAR 
						test asked you "Give me an example of a math problem that equals 4", most of you would 
						say "2+2".  This is a well known fact, 2+2 = 4. But the STAAR test says no, we wanted 
						3+1. You gave the right answer, but not in the form they requested.  This program was 
						designed to teach strategies to help you understand how to play the game and pass the 
						test. You need 43% correct to pass. You have 5 hours to take the EOC, within those 
						5 hours you must work on a two part test (reading and writing). Understanding across 
						Genres usually makes up 8 out of the 52 multiple choice questions. 
						These questions are always a combination of two readings</p>
