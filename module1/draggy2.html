		<li><span class="target" data-accept="important">&nbsp;</span>  Every year when I was a child, a man brought a big, black, squeaking machine to school.When he discovered I couldn't hear all his peeps and squeaks, he would get very excited. The nurse would draw a chart with a deep canyon in it. Then I would listen to the squeaks two or three times, while the adults - who were all acting very, very nice - would watch me raise my hand. Sometimes I couldn't tell whether I heard the squeaks or just imagined them, but I liked being the center of attention.
</li><br>
		<li><span class="target" data-accept="number">&nbsp;</span><span class="target" data-accept="important">&nbsp;</span><span class="target" data-accept="heart">&nbsp;</span>My parents said I lost my hearing to pneumonia as a baby, but I knew I hadn't lost anything. None of my parts had dropped off. Nothing had changed: if I wanted to listen to Beethoven, I could put my head between the speakers and turn the dial up to 7. I could hear jets at the airport a block away. I could hear my mom when she was in the same room - if I wanted to. I could even hear my cat purr if I put my good ear right on top of him.</li><br>
		<li><span class="target" data-accept="number">&nbsp;</span><span class="target" data-accept="important">&nbsp;</span>I wasn't aware of not hearing until I began to wear a hearing aid at the age of 30. It shattered my peace: shoes creaking, papers crackling, pencils tapping, phones ringing, refrigerators humming, people cracking knuckles, clearing throats and blowing noses! Cars, bikes, dogs, cats, kids all seemed to appear from nowhere and fly right at me.</li><br>
		<li><span class="target" data-accept="heart">&nbsp;</span> I was constantly startled, unnerved, agitated - exhausted. I felt as though inquisitorial Nazis in an old World War II film were burning the side of my head with a merciless white spotlight. Under that onslaught, I had to break down and confess: I couldn't hear. Suddenly, I began to discover many things I couldn't do. </li><br>
